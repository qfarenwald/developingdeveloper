    <p><a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/" target="_blank">Sketch</a> is "the digital design toolkit" and is all the rage for laying out website and app flows and even creating working prototypes.</p>
      <h4>Sketch Features I Love</h4>
        <p> The ability to make objects into symbols is such a time saver! By turning an object into a symbol, universal updates of that symbol are now possible. In this site, I made the header, footer, and faces all symbols. To explain what a symbol is; let's say Mark thinks the cartoon face I drew of Colby needs different color eyes. Instead of updating each and every Colby face individually, since his face is a symbol, all I have to do is edit one face and all of Colby's faces will update with that edit automatically! Wow, I said 'faces' a lot.</p>
        <p>Protoyping is the coolest, especially being new to designing digital and interactive projects. Actually being able to move around what I've designed helps me understand the flow infinitely better than simply moving my eyes from artboard to artboard. Being able to prototype my initial design and see how it flowed or didn't flow really helped me know what edits were required for round two. The process of dragging the arrows around the artboards to show the flow and create the clickable working prototype is insanely easy as well. Just a few clicks. I sat down and expected it to take hours to set up... nope, minutes.</p>
      <h4>Sketch Frustrations I Have</h4>
        <p>I would like to have the little faces dance back and forth before they are clicked on for the first time. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvBGFeXbBrq3W9_0oNLJREQ" target="_blank">Jesse Showalter</a> is one of the many YouTube channels to which I subscribe. of course he had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJqPVOapq7A" target="_blank">video</a> on how to do it. He downloads a plugin called <a href="https://timeline.animaapp.com/" target="_blank">anima</a> to specifically use the Timeline feature. Timeline allows you to animate directly in Sketch. Creating an animation was super easy, but I had a problem after creating an animation. I could not actually see the animation on my artboards or even in prototype mode. The animation looked like a still image. The animation worked in the 'Preview in Browser' option in the anima tool bar, but I also did not get the desired effect here. My heading text color was reversed from black to white. I watched a bunch of other tutorials and none showed how the final product of an anima animation was actually used on a Sketch artboard. My assumption is that the animation must be exported as a GIF then pasted onto the desired artboard in Sketch...? I downloaded the free trial of anima and downloading your animation as a GIF is not an option. So I am going to pop on over to Illustrator and Photoshop, and make my GIF there.</p>
        <p>Well first off, leaving Sketch and using Illustrator and Photoshop to create a GIF is quite an annoying process. When I was first trying to figure out the animation in Sketch/anima, I thought, I should just do it the way I know how, it will be much easier and probably be faster. Wrong. Compared to the time it took me to make my animation in Sketch, it took quite a bit longer doing it 'my way'... 1 min in Sketch vs 5 mins in the Adobe products. And when I tried to import or paste my new GIF into my Sketch artboards, my GIF still is not animating. Hmmm? To be continued...</p>
        <p>Also, the Sketch preview stops working every once and a while and I need to restart Sketch. Annoying.</p>
