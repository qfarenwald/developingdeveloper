    <p><a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/" target="_blank">Sketch</a> is "the digital design toolkit" that is all the rage for laying out product wireframes, to designing high res mock ups and even to creating clickable working prototypes. I used Sketch to create the clickable prototype for my personal project <a href="https://qfarenwald.github.io/developingdeveloper/emilyandcolby" target="_blank">Emily & Colby</a>. Through my brief interaction with the free trial version of Sketch, I was able to become familiar with the basics of the product quickly.</p>
      <h4>Sketch Features I Love</h4>
        <p> The ability to make objects into symbols is such a time saver! By turning an object into a symbol, universal updates of that symbol are now possible. For <a href="https://qfarenwald.github.io/developingdeveloper/emilyandcolby" target="_blank">Emily & Colby</a>, I made the header, footer, and faces all symbols. To explain what a symbol is; let's say I noticed Colby has different colored eyes than I depicted in my illustration of him. Instead of updating each and every Colby eyeball individually, since his face is a symbol, all I have to do is edit the eye color in one face. The rest of Colby's faces will update with that eye color edit automatically!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Prototyping is the coolest, especially being new to designing digital and interactive projects. Actually being able to move around what I've designed helps me understand the flow infinitely better than simply moving my eyes from artboard to artboard. Being able to prototype my initial design of <a href="https://qfarenwald.github.io/developingdeveloper/emilyandcolby" target="_blank">Emily & Colby</a> and see how it flowed or didn't flow really helped me know what edits were required for round two. The process of dragging the arrows around the artboards to show the flow and create the clickable working prototype is insanely easy as well. Just a few clicks. I sat down and expected it to take hours to set up... nope, minutes... dare I say seconds.</p>
      <h4>Sketch Frustrations I Have</h4>
        <p>I will note right away that I only played around with the free trial version of Sketch which could be cause to these issues. Seems odd but so are the difficulties I had in the program below.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the <a href="https://qfarenwald.github.io/developingdeveloper/emilyandcolby" target="_blank">Emily & Colby</a> project, I would like to have the little faces dance back and forth before they are clicked on for the first time. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvBGFeXbBrq3W9_0oNLJREQ" target="_blank">Jesse Showalter</a> is one of the many YouTube channels to which I subscribe. Of course he had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJqPVOapq7A" target="_blank">video</a> on how to animate within Sketch. He downloads a plugin called <a href="https://timeline.animaapp.com/" target="_blank">anima</a> to specifically use the Timeline feature. Timeline allows you to animate directly in Sketch. Creating an animation was super easy but I had a problem after creating an animation. I could not actually see the animation on my artboards or even in prototype mode. The animation still looked like a still image. </p>
        <br>
          <p>The animation worked in the 'Preview in Browser' option in the anima tool bar, but I also did not get the desired effect here. My heading text color was reversed from black to white. What? Why?</p>
          <br>
             <p>I watched a bunch of other tutorials and none showed how the final product of an anima animation was actually used on a Sketch artboard. My assumption is that the animation must be exported as a GIF then pasted onto the desired artboard in Sketch...? Since I downloaded the free trial of Sketch, downloading an animation as a GIF is not an option. So I decided to pop on over to Illustrator and Photoshop and make my GIF there.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I discovered leaving Sketch and using Illustrator and Photoshop to create a GIF is actually quite an annoying process. When I was first trying to figure out the animation in Sketch/anima, I thought, I should just do it the way I know how in Adobe products, it will be much easier and probably be faster. Wrong. Compared to the time it took me to make my animation in Sketch, it took quite a bit longer doing it 'my way'... 1 min in Sketch vs 5 mins in the Adobe products. And when I tried to import or paste my new GIF into my Sketch artboards, my GIF still is not animating. Hmmm? To be continued...</p>
        <br>
        <p>Also, the Sketch preview stops working every once and a while and I need to restart Sketch. Annoying.</p>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p>I have just barely scratched the surface of Sketch. During my quick exploration I found aspects I loved and an almost equal amount of aspects that frustrated me. Perhaps user error, perhaps not. As I continue to work in Sketch and perhaps competitor programs like <a href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank">Figma</a> or <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html" target="_blank">Adobe XD</a>, I will be able to update this post with more educated feedback and comparisons.</p>
