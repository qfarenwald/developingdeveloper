      <p>Done. is far from being done. 'Done.' is the name of the first app I am creating with my developer friends, <a href="https://medium.com/@markevan100" target="_blank">Mark</a> (backend talent) and Sav (full stack talent). I am the UX/UI/frontend talent. Together, with our powers combined... we hope to make something that is simple, concise, done.</p>
      <p>The basic concept of Done. is an app that helps teachers reduce time writing end of semester reports or comments for each student. Those reports, depending on the amount of students a teacher has, can take hours, even days. By automating a bulk of the report text, the program will allow teachers to insert and only fill out a few customizable fields per student instead of writing the entire report over and over. Time is precious. It's gratifying when the reports are done and there is still time to be had on your weekend.</p>
    <h4>The Spark</h4>
      <p>Mark is a private high school Spanish teacher. Each semester ends with the grueling task of writing personalized student reports; summarizing the semester, providing feedback and recommendations for the following year. Mark averages 100 students per semester. Each report takes 20 mins. That's 33 hrs of report writing time... over 3 days! Mark cares deeply about each student, but when writing so many reports the verbage and overall messages are quite repetitive.</p>
      <p>We all wish we had more time and look for ways save and use time more efficiently.</p>
    <h4>The Initial Protoype</h4>
      <p>It was Thursday. With reports due the following Monday, Mark thought fast. Could he build a working program that would help him write his reports quickly and grant him a free weekend? Or would he attempt to build a program, fail, only wasting time, then have to write his reports anyway? Mark felt confident he could succeed and called upon Sav to help him get the program running.</p>
      <p>Shortly, I will add a screen cast of Mark's and Sav's inital working program... spoiler alert... a success!</p>
    <h4>Going Further</h4>
      <p>Could this app help other teachers as it did Mark? Could we take this simple, yet specific little spanish student report writing program and generalize it for a use of any teacher for any subject? Could we build a beautiful, elegant interface that is easy to use and makes teachers want to rely on it at the end of their semesters?</p>
      <p>We say yes. Enter my participation to help create a wonderful, simple user experience and interface for Done.</p>
      <p>Our goal with the UX/UI is to make something simple. Think before you imitate. We want to do what is best for our app, regardless of what other apps have done before us.</p>
    <h4>The Technical Stuff</h4>
      <p>Frontend: Bootstrap. Backend: Rails.</p>
      <p>Why? I'll get back to you on that.</p>
