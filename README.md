# Developing Developer

My concept for this blog is to produce thoughtful technical posts along with visually enhancing the usability and design as I learn and evolve as a developer. It is apparent the coding of this homepage is bare bones, as is the coding of the first handful of posts. I plan to leave these pages as they are, as reminder of where I started. The more I learn about development the more I will be able to add to the structure and design of each new post. I will highlight when a new coding feature has been applied. Watch as I learn.

### Focuses

- Build upon developing and design techniques as I learn.

- Articulate both technical and non technical challenges that arise in my journey.

### Tech

- Utilizes the basic building blocks of HTML and CSS.

### Team (Solo)
