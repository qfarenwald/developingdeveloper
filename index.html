    <h3>Developing My Future</h3>
      <p>My concept for this blog is to produce thoughtful technical posts along with visually enhancing the usability and design as I learn and evolve as a developer. It is apparent the coding of this homepage is bare bones, as is the coding of the first handful of posts. I plan to leave these pages as they are, as reminder of where I started. The more I learn about development the more I will be able to add to the structure and design of each new post. I will <span class="bluetext">highlight</span> when a new coding feature has been applied. Watch as I learn.</p>
