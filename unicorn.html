      <p>My story of entering the digital design realm as a print designer is a like walking down a path. For the past 10 years, that path has been singular, flat and mostly unwavering. The path eventually begins feels too familiar and a desire for adventure creeps in. Something unknown appears up ahead. A woods. I enter curiously. This new world appears lush and full of life yet unknown. Abruptly, the path forks.</p>

    <h4>The Left Path</h4>
      <p>Down the left path is the field of Front End Development. I'll use an analogy through the rest of the post to help explain each path in a way we can all relate. Let's use the common unicorn. A unicorn has a skeleton provides its body a structure. Front end developers create the skeleton for a digital product, called code, which all other elements like design, copy and user flow are set upon.</p>
      <p>The left path is the most different from that which I have been traveling. I realize this path will be less visually creative. Most likely other designers will pass their prototypes and designs for me to code. No longer will I pick colors and design styles. But I will get to decide how the product is structured and that in itself can be beautiful; when a product loads quickly and reacts seamlessly. There is something also peaceful about coding. Things either work or they don't. In the graphic design world I hail from success is most often subjectively determined by the client.</p>
      <p>I have many strengths that will prepare me for success as a front end developer. I am very organized and detail oriented. During excruciatingly detailed tasks I seem to lose myself in a peaceful trance, for example prepping apparel artwork for print in my current position. I find joy in efficiency and simplicity. Writing clean code and producing a product that works phenomenally excites and drives me to pursue further education. Perhaps because I am still new to coding I remain awestruck when the code I write becomes a visual working site on screen.</p>

    <h4>The Right Path</h4>
      <p>Down the right path is the field of UX/UI. Also known as user experience and user interface. This path forks again at its start as UX and UI roles do differ. Back to the unicorn analogy. A unicorn has organs that regulate how the unicorn functions and feels. UX designers create the organs for a digital product and determine how the product works, feels and interacts with the user. A unicorn also is also stunningly beautiful with a silky mane, glittering hooves, and fluorescent rainbow coloring. UI designers make each digital product beautiful to gaze upon.</p>
      <p>The right path is more familiar to me than the left path. UI being the most familiar. My graphic design career up to this point has been print and apparel design. Both mediums require beautiful aesthetics married to clear communication for its user. Creating good UI for a digital product is similar but will take some adaptation as digital products require many elements that print collateral and apparel do not require. Two quick examples are buttons and menus. Print collateral and apparel also have very limited user experience. Once either are printed their adaptability to the user ends. Digital products have the ability to continuously learn and evolve for the user. </p>
      <p>I also have many strengths that will prepare me for success as a UX/UI designer. My decade long graphic design career has built an incredibly strong visual design foundation and has taught me the skills to communicate effectively through design. I am incredibly empathetic to all things. In college I came close to minoring in psychology alongside my graphic design degree due to pure interest in how people think and act. To learn about the users and create a product that meets their needs or solves a problem in the most elegant way possible makes me smile. I desire to make an impact.</p>

    <h4>A Unicorn</h4>
      <p>As I stand, deliberating which path, I feel a nudge on my shoulder. I turn to face a not an analogy, but a real unicorn. It speaks, obviously, and whinnies "You don't need to choose one path. Just become a unicorn fly between the two." "Well", I reply, "I had not thought this an option." The analogy here is if one can become skillful in all paths they become a very special, rare and therefore desired beast.</p>
      <p>While as daunting as this option feels, and seemingly impossible, it would be so fun to be a unicorn. The past few weeks, I've been practicing tons of digital skills. At first it was to see which path I would enjoy more and continue down. But the benefits of being a unicorn are becoming clear. First, one could fly. Second, to be familiar with all these paths would allow for a more seamless and efficient process. When creating a product I am frustrated when I do not know if an idea is able to be created in code. When coding a product I am worried if this product has good UX/UI due to my lack of experience. Third, becoming proficient in all these fields would allow for better communication with other members of a product team. I do not believe one person, even a unicorn can actually take on all positions at one company. However, whichever position they are placed, if they know the basics of all the other positions, it would be a magical thing.</p>
      <p>I have yet to choose a path. But I have been camping out at the fork with the unicorn becoming more familiar daily with the landscape. A fire has been lit within and it burns hotter each day with the fuel of grit, determination and inspiration. </p>
